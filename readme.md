This repository contains small problem statements and stupid exercises carried out while learning certain concepts and Programming Languages.

I hope this folder will make me practice everyday and grow.
In this Readme, I will be sharing my experiments and general experience of trying to practice and failing here. This is my third iteration of making a repository that actsa a dumpster for all things I learn. The older updated versions are present in OLD_MINE Repo, which has codes and practice scripts from when I was an absolute beginner. As of now, concepts and ideas are my strong suites, but due to lack of practice my efficiency and creative thinking have taken a toll. Hope to be the best I can be through this lockdown by utilising some time everyday to learn to be efficient again
